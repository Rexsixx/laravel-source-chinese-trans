 * Handler or Processor implementing this interface will be reset when Logger::reset() is called.
 * 当调用Logger::reset()时，实现此接口的Handler或Processor将被重置。

 * Resetting ends a log cycle gets them back to their initial state.
 * 重置结束了一个日志循环，使它们恢复到初始状态。
 *
 * Resetting a Handler or a Processor means flushing/cleaning all buffers, resetting internal
 * state, and getting it back to a state in which it can receive log records again.
 *
 * This is useful in case you want to avoid logs leaking between two requests or jobs when you
 * have a long running process like a worker or an application server serving multiple requests
 * in one process.
